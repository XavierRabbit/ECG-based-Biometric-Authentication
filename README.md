# ECG-based-Biometric-Authentication
<ul>
 <li>
   The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an emerging novel biometric approach for human identification. The ECG is unique to an individual, with benefits such as resilience to replay attacks and spoofing.

     Firstly, I contributed to the development of an algorithm to identify ECG uniquely. I used AD8232 ECG sensor to acquire ECG Signals in real-time.

      Then, my team acquired Digital ECG Signals of 50 individuals and stored them using Serial Communication (MATLAB).

     This was followed by the Signal Preprocessing step for noise reduction. Finally, Classification methods were used for pattern recognition. Additionally, I developed a C# based Folder Locker and executed MATLAB Script for ECG Authentication
